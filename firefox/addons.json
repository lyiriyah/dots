It comes with advanced ways to select what links to download, and will remember your previous decisions so that you can queue more downloads with just OneClick!\n\nAdvanced users will also like using renaming masks, which let you automatically assign names (and even sub-folders within your downloads folder), fast-filtering or even custom, re-usable filters.\n\nDownThemAll is open-source and free. We spend a lot of time making it, and keep spending a lot of time improving it, and even fixing some problems in Firefox itself so DownThemAll! can work even better.\nWe will never add adware, spyware, user tracking or other nasty stuff. Therefore we rely on your donations exclusively to fund the development.\n\nWe are looking for people willing to help translate DownThemAll! to more languages. For a small guide on how to do that, please see our preliminary translation guide. You will get our gratitude, and the gratitude of all the users whose live you improved by bringing DownThemAll! to their language.\n\nPlease do NOT report any bugs and issues in the user review section, but file a bug report instead. This is the only way to make sure we actually see it, and it also makes communicating to us/with you a lot easier. Thanks\n\nPlease note: Version 4 of DownThemAll! is.a complete rewrite as a WebExtension, as the old add-on system was abandoned and disabled in Firefox. This was mozilla's decision, and there is nothing we can do about it. We are therefore limited to the tools the WebExtensions model provides to us, which sadly makes it impossible to provide some of the advanced features of DownThemAll! Version 3. Furthermore there are some bugs in Firefox that affect DownThemAll! as well, e.g. downloads will always succeed even if the server returns an error, but I fixed this in upcoming Firefox 71.\nHowever, we're still able to provide the advanced selection, queuing, file naming options of the old DownThemAll! and a lot more.","weeklyDownloads":7402,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Nils Maier","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/105689/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/224/224229.png?modified=1574345219","width":2400,"height":1463,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/224/224229.png?modified=1574345219","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":390,"caption":"Quickly select links using advanced filters, automatically name files and folders with highly configurable masks"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/224/224230.png?modified=1574345219","width":2274,"height":1504,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/224/224230.png?modified=1574345219","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":423,"caption":"Watch your download queue progress according to your global and per-domain limits.\r\nQuickly filter and search your queue to manage to find specific downloads in your queue."},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/224/224231.png?modified=1574345219","width":506,"height":626,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/224/224231.png?modified=1574345219","thumbnailWidth":388,"thumbnailHeight":480,"caption":"DownThemAll! comes with a button that will allow you to quickly access it's main features, but it can be configured to be a OneClick! button instead."},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/224/224232.png?modified=1574345219","width":1222,"height":1104,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/224/224232.png?modified=1574345219","thumbnailWidth":531,"thumbnailHeight":480,"caption":"Add downloads from your context menu, e.g. the link, image or video you clicked, or only from queue from the part of the website you selected."},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/224/224233.png?modified=1574345219","width":1072,"height":788,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/224/224233.png?modified=1574345219","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":470,"caption":"DownThemAll! is also present in your tools menu, so you still have full access to its features even when you configured it to not show the context menu and changed the button to OneClick!"},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/224/224234.png?modified=1574345219","width":1624,"height":966,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/224/224234.png?modified=1574345219","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":381,"caption":"Of course, you can manually add downloads, too."},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/224/224235.png?modified=1574345219","width":1624,"height":966,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/224/224235.png?modified=1574345219","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":381,"caption":"Batch downloads are supported as well."},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/224/224236.png?modified=1574345219","width":2274,"height":1576,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/224/224236.png?modified=1574345219","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":444,"caption":"DownThemAll! comes with powerful preferences that let power users make the most of the extension, but also provides sensible defaults for people who just want to download quickly."}],"contributionURL":"https://paypal.me/NilsMaier?utm_content=product-page-contribute&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=addons.mozilla.org","averageRating":4.5235,"reviewCount":2607,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/downthemall/reviews/","updateDate":1574777386000},{"id":"{506e023c-7f2b-40a3-8066-bc5deb40aebe}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/819/819184-32.png?modified=5b6fdd2e","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/819/819184-64.png?modified=5b6fdd2e","128":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/819/819184-128.png?modified=5b6fdd2e"},"name":"Gesturefy","version":"3.0.7","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/3639516/gesturefy-3.0.7-fx.xpi","homepageURL":"https://github.com/Robbendebiene/Gesturefy","supportURL":"https://github.com/Robbendebiene/Gesturefy/issues","description":"Navigate, operate, and browse faster with mouse gestures! A customizable mouse gesture add-on with a variety of different commands.","fullDescription":"Gesturefy is a pure mouse gesture extension, which means it's only suited for mice and not touchpads. \"What's a mouse gesture?\" you might ask yourself. Well, mouse gestures are like keyboard shortcuts, only for your mouse. Instead of pressing a bunch of keys, you simply move your mouse in a certain manner to execute commands and actions. Mouse gestures can be more natural and convenient than keyboard shortcuts and thus are also suitable for casual users. Wait, is that a mouse in your hand? Come and try it out :)\n\nFeatures:\n\n    Mouse gestures (moving the mouse while holding the left, middle, or right button)\n    More than 70 different predefined commands\n    Customizable gesture trace and status information style\n    Rocker gestures (left-click while holding the right mouse button and vice versa)\n    Wheel gestures (scroll wheel while holding the left, middle, or right button)\n    Multilingual, thanks to volunteers on Crowdin\n    User script support\n    Blacklist support\n\n\nLimitations:\n\n    Gesturefy does not work on Mozilla related pages like addons.mozilla.org, internal pages like about:addons or other add-on option pages (e.g. moz-extension://*).

These permissions are not needed to install and use New Tab Override:\n\n- access data for www.soeren-hentzschel.at\n\nThe permission to access data for www.soeren-hentzschel.at is only needed if you enable the option to see the latest news about Mozilla as new tab page. If enabled, New Tab Override reads the feed of www.soeren-hentzschel.at to show you the latest news.\n\nSilent permissions. New Tab Override requires additional permissions, but Firefox does not prompt requests for the following:\n\n- menus\n\nThe menus permission is needed for providing an entry in the tools menu for accessing New Tab Override's settings.\n\n- storage\n\nThe storage permission is needed so that New Tab Override can store settings such as your new tab page.\n\nCompatibility\n\nThe extension requires at least Firefox 78.

Unfortunately, I have no way to test the extension on MacOS!\n    This extension is a generalist file downloader: for some very specific types it may be better to use other, more specialized extensions (video downloaders, for example).\n    The extension doesn't work in private browsing mode.\n    The user defined folders are only relative to default browser's download directory; this is a general web extensions security limitation.\n\n\n\nFREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS\n\n\nQuestion 1. How to use this extension?\n\nAnswer Say for example you have opened a web page with many pdf resources. The most basic workflow it to open the extension popup (via the browser toolbar icon) and click there the Load page links button. This usually fills the resources list with all sort of links, not only the desired pdfs. So the next step is to filter this list, such that only desired pdfs stays here. Write pdf in the extensions text field. Now only pdf type resources show in the list. If the list is still too large (you want only smaller subset) you may continue the filtering process indicating some relevant terms in the next text filter field. Finally, you check desired items individually or all at once and start immediate downloading using the corresponding button (on right bottom corner).\nThe downloading items are now visible in the downloads tab of the popup; you can manage this list in the usual manner (pause, resume, open or remove individual items etc)\n\n\nQuestion 2. How about other alternative workflows?\n\nAnswer The general idea of the extension is to collect links to the resources list (with optional filtering) and finally to add checked items to the download queue. The collecting stage has many variations:\n\n    using the web page context-menu: you can right-click individual links from the web page or a larger selected text region\n    using the special tabs dialog; here you can collect links from active tab| all tabs| right tabs|left tabs and even decide if the collected links must be immediately downloaded or if the associated tabs must be finally closed.\n    add links from the clipboard text using a dedicated menu (note that this clipboard text must have every url on a separate line)\n\n\n\nQuestion 3. The resource list has too many links and I find it difficult to recognize the wanted ones!\n\nAnswer By default, the resource list displays the estimated filenames of the collected links. These names are usually different from those displayed on the web page. There are many possible strategies here:\n\n    If the desired items are images, it may be better to use the thumbnails view (there is a special toggle button for this). Here the images can be sorted by descending order or filtered by width/height.\n    If you know the file extensions of the desired items, you can use this info for the extensions filter box.\n    Sometimes it may be better to select a text zone on the web page (including relevant links) and use the context menu to extract only links from this selected text range.\n    More generally, it's important to know that every item has some textual info associated to it. This info comes from the web attributes of that item, more precisely\n        the url (the link address) visible on the status bar when you hover the link (on the web page)\n        the filename, usually included in the url\n        the link text (as you see on the web page)\n        the title text from the tooltip you see when hovering the link (on the web page)\n        the alt text (alternative text, usually associated with images)\n        You can use all this available info to identify some specific words/terms associated with your desired items. Next, you must input this terms in the text filter box using an easy syntax, for example, url:word_1 text: word_2 title:word_3. Or simpler, all: word if you are not sure where the word comes from.\n    Every item in the resource list can be right-clicked and this will reveal an informative popup will all info known for that item.\n\n\n\nQuestion 4. How to set a custom download directory?\n\nAnswer On the resource list tab, there is a directory input field. Here the user can set a download directory. A new folder is written in the form aaa/bbb/.../zzz. For example Docs or Docs/Math/Algebra. Please note that every such directory is defined only relative to the default download directory (this is a web extensions security limitation), so you can define only subdirectories of this main directory. Another thing you can do is to use the general browser settings to change the location of this default download directory.\n\nAlso, the user can prepare a custom favorite folders list (see extension's options, the Download directories section). Once defined, this list will be available via autocomplete or simply by double-clicking this text field.\n\n\nQuestion 5. Why there are two add to queue buttons?\n\nAnswer After checking some items from the resource list you can decide to send them either to the active queue, either to the passive queue (using the corresponding buttons). Sending to the active queue means that downloading starts immediately or as soon as possible. This is the best option if you are content with the default names or don't care too much about that. On the other hand, sometimes it's better to rename queued items before starting downloading them. This can be done either individually (using the edit button associated with every item from download list) or in batch mode (using the multi-rename dialog)\n\n\nQuestion 6. I want to download some files from the resource list but I don't like the filenames used there. On the original web page, they had other, better names. How to change that?\n\nAnswer By default, the items on the resource list are displayed with their (estimated) file names, that corresponds to the name mask {name}.{ext}. But if the user clicks the name header of the resources table, he will be able to choose another attribute (url, title, text, alt text) for the actual displaying. The most obvious candidate is the text attribute; that usually corresponds to what the user sees on the web page. In this case, all the items will be displayed with the {text}.{ext} name mask. Sending to the queue will preserve this displayed mask.\n\nBut once the items are added to the queue (not for immediate downloading), it's possible to rename them in more advanced ways. You can select some items and use the available multi-rename dialog for batch renaming them. Here you can set a common name mask using many types of available masks, and combine them in various ways. Also, it's possible here to do other batch operations (search/replace type, setting directories etc)\n\n\nQuestion 7. Your extension is not capable to download embedded videos. Why?\n\nAnswer My extension is, indeed, not designed to download embedded videos or streaming media (but only normal, direct links). For these, it's better to use more specialized video/media downloaders. The main reason is that these extensions are most exposed to all sorts of legal issues and I don't want my extension to be taken down. Though, in the future, it's possible to add some more support for these types.\n\n\nQuestion 8. Your extension is not capable to download files from sites X, Y, Z...Why?\n\nAnswer My extension tries always to detect links that are included in the html source of the web pages. But sometimes this doesn't work well. Many sites don't really like their resources to be mass downloaded because this way the users skip the associated ads. So, in some cases, the URLs are embedded in nonstandard ways or, even worse, the resources are visible on the page as \"fake\" links, meaning that the real URLs of the resources are generated by the server on the fly, only when the user clicks their name.\n\nOne solution to this problem is to use an appropriate userscript designed specifically for the site X. There are some very popular userscript managers around, for example Greasemonkey on Firefox or Tampermonkey on Chrome. If the user knew some javascript he may be able to build for site X a special userscript which facilitates subsequent downloading using Simple Mass Downloader extension. More precisely, my extension can recognize the special attributes data-smd-url and data-smd-name and use them for mass downloading. Of course, the main problem here is to build the helper userscript. This implies that the (knowledgeable) user manually analyze the source of the page, and build de appropriate userscript with the aim of embedding into the page (via this special attributes) the information required for download.\n\nAnother solution is to find eventually another extension designed specifically for the site X. There are many extensions of this type. For example one for Google Images downloading, other for SoundCloud etc. There are great chances to find such an extension if the site X is really a very popular one.\n\n\nQuestion 9. Your extension is not capable to download the full-sized images, but only the thumbnails...Why?\n\nAnswer As for the previous question, it's possible that only the thumbnail links are included in the html source and the full links are obscured using various javascript tricks. See the previous answer for details and solutions.\n\n\nQuestion 10. There are too many bugs! You are aware of them?\n\nAnswer This extension is still in early development, so, unfortunately, bugs are still expected. Also, I tried to add quite a lot of features and this increased complexity means usually more bugs. Hopefully, this situation will be considerably improved as we approach version 1.00.","weeklyDownloads":383,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"George

It's especially good for programmers who write email with code in them -- it even supports syntax highlighting. And for the mathematicians among us: Markdown Here will render TeX formulae as well.\n\nTotally simple to use:\n1. Write your email in your email client's rich editor using Github-flavoured Markdown.\n2. Right-click in the compose area and then click \"Markdown Toggle\".\n3. Your email is now pretty! (That is, it's been rendered to HTML.)\n4. If you like the way it looks, just send it. If you want to change or add something, click \"Markdown Toggle\" again to get back to your original Markdown.\n5. Repeat as necessary.\n\nMarkdown Here is primarily targeted to work with Gmail and Thunderbird, but it also works pretty well with Yahoo and Hotmail. Additionally, it works great with Google Groups and Sites, Evernote's web interface, Blogger, Wordpress, and more!\n\nSyntax highlighting note: Use fenced code blocks and specify the language name. See the project page for an example.\n\nPrivacy: Markdown Here accesses and modifies web content when you activate it. It can, in theory, access other web content, but does not. It also makes no Internet requests whatsoever. Your data is modified when and where you choose, and does not leave your browser.\n\nAvailable as a Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, and Thunderbird extension.\n\nThis is an open source project. Visit Markdown Here's Github page for full instructions, more information, bug reports, or to contribute.\n\nhttp://markdown-here.com\nhttps://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here","weeklyDownloads":95,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Adam Pritchard","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/6225309/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/184/184876.png?modified=1543520831","width":700,"height":438,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/184/184876.png?modified=1543520831","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":400},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/184/184877.png?modified=1543520832","width":700,"height":438,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/184/184877.png?modified=1543520832","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":400},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/184/184880.png?modified=1543520833","width":700,"height":438,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/184/184880.png?modified=1543520833","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":400},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/184/184881.png?modified=1543520834","width":700,"height":438,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/184/184881.png?modified=1543520834","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":400},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/184/184882.png?modified=1543520835","width":700,"height":438,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/184/184882.png?modified=1543520835","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":400},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/184/184883.png?modified=1543520836","width":700,"height":438,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/184/184883.png?modified=1543520836","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":400}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.7619,"reviewCount":23,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/markdown-here/reviews/","updateDate":1496321015000},{"id":"tridactyl.vim@cmcaine.co.uk","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/873/873070-32.png?modified=1593512247","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/873/873070-64.png?modified=1593512247","128":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/873/873070-128.png?modified=1593512247"},"name":"Tridactyl","version":"1.20.3","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/3685852/tridactyl-1.20.3-an+fx.xpi","homepageURL":"https://github.com/cmcaine/tridactyl","supportURL":"https://github.com/cmcaine/tridactyl/issues","description":"Vim, but in your browser. Replace Firefox's control mechanism with one modelled on Vim.\n\nThis addon is very usable, but is in an early stage of development. We intend to implement the majority of Vimperator's features.","fullDescription":"Control your browser with your keyboard only.\nReplace Firefox’s control mechanism with one modelled on VIM. This is a “Firefox Quantum” replacement for VimFX, Vimperator and Pentadactyl. Most common tasks you want your browser to perform are bound to a single key press:\n\n    You want to open a new tab? Hit t.\n    You want to follow that link? Hit f and type the displayed label. (Note: hint characters should be typed in lowercase.)\n    You want to go to the bottom of the page? Hit G. Or the top? gg.\n    You want to focus the text field on Wikipedia to search for another term? gi.\n    Switch to the next tab? gt.\n    Go back in time? H.\n    Notice that this tab is rubbish and you want to close it? d.\n    Regret that decision? u restores it.\n    Want to write something in Vim? Ctrl-i in a text box opens it in Vim, if you have :native working.\n    Temporarily disable all that magic because you can’t stand it? Shift-Insert or Ctrl-Alt-Escape.\n    But how do you use your browser now? Shift-Insert or Ctrl-Alt-Escape again and we’re back on.\n\nThe list could go on a bit here, but I guess you’ll get the point. If you feel lost sometimes :help might help you a lot, and there’s always :tutor.\nHighlighted features:\n\n    Follow any link on the site with just 2-3 key presses.\n    Switch to any open tab by searching for its URL or title or entering its ID.\n    Easy customizable search settings.\n    Bind any supported command or commands to the key (sequence) of your liking.\n    Great default bindings (if you’re used to Pentadactyl or Vimperator).\n\nThis add-on is very usable, but is in an early stage of development. We intend to implement the majority of Vimperator’s features.\nYou can get beta builds from our website.\nPermissions:\nSince Tridactyl aims to provide all the features Vimperator and Pentadactyl had, it requires quite a few permissions. Here we describe the specific permissions and why we need them.\n\n    Access your data for all websites:\n        This is Mozilla’s way of saying that Tridactyl can read the content of web pages. This is necessary in order to e.g. find the links you can follow with the :hint command (bound to f by default).\n    Exchange messages with programs other than Firefox:\n        This permission is required for Tridactyl to interact with your operating system (opening your editor to edit text areas, sending links to your video player, reading a configuration file from your disk…). This is possible thanks to an external executable we provide. If you feel this gives Tridactyl too much power you can chose not to install the external executable: Tridactyl will still work but won’t be able to start external programs.\n    Read and modify bookmarks:\n        Tridactyl’s command line has a powerful autocompletion mechanism. In order to be able to autocomplete your bookmarks, Tridactyl needs to read them.\n    Clear recent browsing history, cookies, and related data:\n        Tridactyl implements the :sanitise command Vimperator and Pentadactyl had. It works a bit like the “Clear All History” dialog you can access by pressing Ctrl+Shift+Del on default Firefox.\n    Get data from the clipboard:\n        If your clipboard contains a URL, pressing p will make Tridactyl follow this URL in the current tab.\n    Input data to the clipboard:\n        Tridactyl lets you copy various elements to the clipboard such as a page’s URL with yy, a link’s URL with ;y or the content of an HTML element with ;p.\n    Download files and read and modify the browser’s download history:\n        By pressing ;s, ;S, ;a and ;A you can save documents and pictures from a page to your download folder.\n    Access browsing history:\n        The URLs of websites you’ve visited previously can be suggested as arguments for :tabopen and similar commands.\n    Access recently closed tabs:\n        If you’ve accidentally closed a tab or window, Tridactyl will let you open it again with the :undo command which is bound to u by default.\n    Access browser tabs:\n        Tridactyl provides a quick tab-switching menu/command with the :buffer command (bound to b). This permission is also required to close, move, and pin tabs, amongst other things.\n    Access browser activity during navigation:\n        This is needed for Tridactyl to be able to go back to normal mode every time you open a new page. In the future we may use it for autocommands.\n    Read the text of all open tabs:\n        This allows us to use Firefox’s built-in find-in-page API, for, for example, allowing you to bind find-next and find-previous to n and N.\n    Monitor extension usage and manage themes:\n        Tridactyl needs this to integrate with and avoid conflicts with other extensions. For example, Tridactyl’s contextual identity features use this to cooperate with the Multi-Account Containers extension.","weeklyDownloads":160,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Colin Caine","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/12807200/"},"developers":[{"name":"Oliver Blanthorn","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/13422900/"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/202/202002.png?modified=1543520971","width":2400,"height":1350,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/202/202002.png?modified=1543520971","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":360},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/193/193704.png?modified=1543520972","width":700,"height":385,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/193/193704.png?modified=1543520972","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":352},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/193/193703.png?modified=1543520973","width":700,"height":385,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/193/193703.png?modified=1543520973","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":352},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/193/193705.png?modified=1543520974","width":700,"height":385,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/193/193705.png?modified=1543520974","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":352},{"url":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/full/191/191470.png?modified=1543520975","width":700,"height":384,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/previews/thumbs/191/191470.png?modified=1543520975","thumbnailWidth":640,"thumbnailHeight":351}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.8316,"reviewCount":146,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tridactyl-vim/reviews/","updateDate":1606569922000},{"id":"{21f1ba12-47e1-4a9b-ad4e-3a0260bbeb26}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/977/977117-32.png?modified=5347b666","64":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/977/977117-64.png?modified=5347b666","128":"https://addons.cdn.mozilla.net/user-media/addon_icons/977/977117-128.png?modified=5347b666"},"name":"Remove Youtube's Suggestions","version":"3.2.1","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/3638387/remove_youtubes_suggestions-3.2.1-fx.xpi","homepageURL":"https://github.com/emumoo/remove-youtube-suggestions","supportURL":"https://github.com/emumoo/remove-youtube-suggestions","description":"Gives you the option to remove recommended videos (and comments) on YouTube.
